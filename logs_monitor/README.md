# java-tron Logs Monitor

## Background

In our monitoring setup, we have chosen to use Loki for log collection. Loki is a lightweight, cost-effective log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Grafana. By integrating Loki with Grafana, we can monitor the logs of our services to gain insights into their status and performance. This combination allows us to create alerts based on log data, enabling proactive monitoring and quick response to potential issues.

The key benefits of using Loki with Grafana include:
- **Simplicity**: Loki's architecture is simpler and easier to set up compared to ElasticSearch.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Loki's lightweight nature reduces resource consumption and operational costs.
- **Seamless Integration**: Loki integrates natively with Grafana, providing a unified interface for both metrics and logs.
- **Scalability**: Loki can scale horizontally to handle large volumes of log data.

In the following sections, we will guide you through the java-tron log system setup process with Loki and Grafana, and demonstrate how to configure alerts based on log data to ensure the health and performance of your services.
