# TRON Docker

This repository provides guidance and tools for the community to quickly get started with TRON network and development.

## Features

### Quick start for single FullNode

This repository includes Docker configurations to quickly start a single TRON FullNode connected to the Mainnet or NileNet. Simply follow the instructions to get your node up and running in no time.

### Private chain setup

You can also use this repository to set up a private TRON blockchain network. This is useful for development and testing purposes. The provided configurations make it straightforward to deploy and manage your own private chain.

### Node monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Monitoring the health and performance of your TRON nodes is made easy with integrated Prometheus and Grafana services. The repository includes configurations to set up these monitoring tools, allowing you to visualize and track various metrics in real time.

### Tools

We also provide tools to facilitate the CI and testing process:
- Gradle Docker: Using Gradle to automate the build and test processes for java-tron image.
- DB Fork: This tool helps launch a private Java-Tron network based on the state of the Mainnet database to support shadow fork testing.
