latestBlockHeaderTimestamp = 1747986162000 # MilliSecond. Used in init setup, setting to current timestamp reduces debug log output and speeds up initialization. This setting does not impact the underlying block production logic.
maintenanceTimeInterval = 21600000
nextMaintenanceTime = 1747996162000 # MilliSecond. Set next maintenance time. It could be anytime. If you set an expired time, it will trigger maintenance logic immediately after node startup.
